`CrayPAT <https://pubs.cray.com/content/S-2632/1.0/cray-perftools-quick-start-guide/perftools-overview>`__
(Cray Performance Measurement and Analysis toolset) is Cray's performance
analysis tool.

CrayPAT provides detailed information about application performance. It can be
used for profiling, tracing and hardware performance counter based analysis. It
also provides access to a wide variety of performance experiments that measure
how an executable program consumes resources while it is running, as well as
several different user interfaces that provide access to the experiment and
reporting functions.

CrayPAT consists of the following main components
    * pat_run - a simplified, easy-to-use version of CrayPAT for
      dynamically-linked executables,
    * perftools-lite - an easy-to-use version of CrayPAT,
    * perftools - CrayPAT, for advanced users:

        * pat_build - used to instrument the program to be analyzed,
        * pat_report - a standalone text report generator that can be use to
          further explore the data generated by instrumented program execution,
    * Apprentice2 - a graphical analysis tool that can be used, in addition to
      pat_report to further explore and visualize the data generated by
      instrumented program execution.
    * Reveal - Reveal helps to identify top time consuming loops, with compiler
      feedback on dependency and vectorization.
    * pat_view - a graphical analysis tool that can be used to view CrayPat
      data. pat_view takes as input several ap2 data sets and creates either a
      graph or the raw data of the scaling information for the input data.
